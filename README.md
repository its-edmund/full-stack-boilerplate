# Boilerplate for Full Stack Application

This template is the absolute minimum to get started with React and Express.

## Development

### Setup

This uses yarn so make sure it is install before using.
Be sure to run `yarn` in `/client` and `/server` to install all dependencies.

### Starting server

Luckily, this template uses concurrently so change directory into `/client` and use `yarn start` to start both client and server.
